            <h2>Towards using Few-Shot Prompt Learning for Automating Model Completion</h2>
            <p>ICSE23 NIER track &middot; May 14, 2023</p>
            <p>We propose a simple yet novel approach to improve completion in domain modeling activities. Our approach exploits the power of large language models by using few-shot prompt learning without the need to train or fine-tune those models with large datasets that are scarce in this field. We implemented our approach and tested it on the completion of static and dynamic domain diagrams. Our initial evaluation shows that such an approach is effective and can be integrated in different ways during the modeling activities.</p>

            <h2>Toward Intelligent Generation of Tailored Concrete Syntax</h2>
            <p>MODELS 2024 &middot; March 2024</p>
            <p>Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE 27th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS 2024).
            <p>This paper presents our novel approach for the intelligent generation of tailored concrete syntax for domain-specific languages. It introduces a framework that enables designers to interact with and customize the concrete syntax according to their needs.</p>
